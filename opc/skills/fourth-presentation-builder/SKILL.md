## Brand Color System (CRITICAL)

### Primary Palette

**Deep Blue #0C4A7D** (Core Brand Color)
- RGB: 12, 74, 125
- Usage: Headers, navigation, key elements, brand presence
- Adds depth and confidence, reflects Fourth heritage with modern edge
- Use in tints for variety and balance

**Teal Green #00B69F** (iQ Signature Color)
- RGB: 0, 182, 159
- Usage: Highlights, call-to-actions, accents, represents AI intelligence
- Central to everything Fourth does - represents energy and intelligence of AI
- The teal from iQ icon is now defining accent across Fourth brand

**Sky Blue #6fb4e3** (Accent Color)
- RGB: 111, 180, 227
- Usage: Accent within vignette, express iQ energy and movement
- Represents fresh thinking and open possibilities

### Secondary Palette

**Midnight Navy #002747**
- RGB: 0, 39, 71
- Usage: Use as black for text and bold highlights
- Strong contrast against all colors except Deep Blue
- AVOID using as background or across large areas

**Cool Grey #CFD1D1**
- RGB: 207, 209, 209
- Usage: Highlighting sections of text
- Use Midnight Navy for text on this color (NOT white - better contrast)

**Soft White #F5F5F5**
- RGB: 245, 245, 245
- Usage: Versatile background color
- Adds depth and breaks up white space
- Navy and Deep Blue work best for text on this shade

### Tertiary Palette (Use Sparingly)

**Sunrise Orange #062A3C**
**Hot Red #d9373b**
**Purple #9279b2**

Tertiary colors add subtle highlights - use lightly to support, not dominate

### Logo Color Usage Rules

**On White or Soft White (#F5F5F5)**:
- Use standard logo (Deep Blue with Teal iQ element)

## Presentation Structure

### Opening (First 3 slides)
1. Title slide - Company name, presentation title, presenter info
2. Agenda - What will be covered
3. Context - Why this matters to audience

### Middle (Core content)
- One key idea per slide maximum
- Visual support when possible (photos, charts, diagrams)
- Build momentum logically
- Use section breaks for major topic changes

### Closing (Final 3 slides)

## Fourth iQ Branding (CRITICAL)

### Spelling Rules
- ALWAYS: lowercase 'i', uppercase 'Q' → "iQ"
- NEVER: "IQ", "Iq", "iq"

### Usage in Text
- Standard tagline: "Powered by iQ"
- NOT: "uses iQ", "with iQ", "has iQ"
- Can bold "iQ" in text or use teal accent color (#00B69F) for emphasis

### Visual iQ Indicators

**Powered by iQ Tab**:
- Teal gradient background with vignette
- White iQ icon
- Shadow effect to lift from background
- Use when showcasing iQ-powered products/features

**iQ Within Charts/Diagrams**:
- Graduated keyline in teal
- Simple teal shape next to row
- Avoid icon-heavy appearance if multiple indicators needed

## Fourth Dimension Messaging

**The Concept**:
The Fourth Dimension represents the new era we're leading in hospitality - where intelligence powers every decision, and time is no longer a constraint. It's the space where Fourth iQ transforms data into intelligent action.

**Usage**:
- Capitalize both words: "Fourth Dimension"
- Use to frame moments of transformation
- Pair with messages of momentum, control, and insight
- Example: "Welcome to the Fourth Dimension - where your operation moves faster than time"

**Never**:
- Use as mere slogan without context
- Feel static or corporate
- Focus on technology alone (connect to human impact)

## Tone of Voice for Presentations

### Energetic
- Active voice, strong action verbs
- "Transform your operations" NOT "Operations can be transformed"
- Show momentum and progress
- Create forward motion in language

### Insightful
- Lead with data and evidence
- "Our analysis of 10,000+ venues shows..." NOT "We think..."
- Demonstrate deep industry knowledge
- Turn data into meaning and meaning into action

### Human
- Conversational, not corporate
- "We understand the complexity of managing shifts" NOT "Our algorithms optimize resource allocation"
- Empathetic to customer challenges
- Plain language, no jargon

### Confident
- Definitive statements
- "This will improve efficiency" NOT "This might help"
- Clear and direct
- Own expertise without arrogance
- Use proof, not hype

## Photography Guidelines for Slides

### Staff Interacting with Software
- Real people in authentic hospitality settings
- Natural lighting, candid moments
- Focus on human connection + technology together
- Diverse representation
- Device in hand, engaged with application

### Software Interface Showcase
- Person cut out against flat color background
- Technology as main focus, person adds context
- Head above colored shape edge, lower body within
- Avoid distracting backgrounds

### Software In Situ
- Location context important (kitchen, restaurant, hotel lobby)
- Color surround on photograph for differentiation
- Shows environment where Fourth adds value

### Real People (Case Studies)
- Short depth of field (subject in focus, background blurred)
- Environment shows their work context
- Authentic, genuine expressions
- Strong relationship with Fourth visible

### Case Study Branding
- Customer product/venue photography
- Lozenge shape with customer logo
- Headline format: "[Customer Name] improved [outcome]"

## White Space Principles

**Don't Overcrowd Slides**:
- If content feels cramped, split into multiple slides
- Better 6 clear slides than 3 cluttered ones

**Respect Margins**:
- Template has built-in margins - don't push content to edges
- Let content breathe

**Strategic Emptiness**:
- Empty areas draw attention to filled areas
- Use blank space to guide viewer's eye
- Don't feel obligated to fill every corner

## Alignment and Visual Balance

**Alignment Rule**: Everything should align to something
- Template has invisible grid guides
- Placeholders snap to grid
- Maintains professional appearance

**Visual Balance**:
- Symmetric: Formal, stable, traditional
- Asymmetric: Dynamic, modern, engaging
- Fourth templates use both appropriately

**Visual Weight**:
- Larger elements feel heavier
- Darker colors feel heavier
- Balance heavy elements with white space
