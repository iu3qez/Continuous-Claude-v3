# Rule: Generating a Task List from User Requirements

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step task list in Markdown format based on user requirements, feature requests, or existing documentation. The task list should guide a developer through implementation.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/tasks/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[feature-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-user-profile-editing.md`)

## Process

1.  **Recall Implementation Patterns (Memory):** Before generating tasks, query memory for similar past implementations:
    ```bash
    cd ~/.claude && PYTHONPATH=. uv run python scripts/core/recall_learnings.py \
      --query "<feature type> implementation tasks" --k 3 --text-only
    ```
    Look for: task breakdown patterns, common subtasks, testing approaches.

2.  **Receive Requirements:** The user provides a feature request, task description, or points to existing documentation

3.  **Analyze Requirements:** The AI analyzes the functional requirements, user needs, and implementation scope from the provided information. **Include insights from memory recall.**

4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Tasks:** Based on the requirements analysis and memory context, create the file and generate the main, high-level tasks required to implement the feature. **IMPORTANT: Always include task 0.0 "Create feature branch" as the first task, unless the user specifically requests not to create a branch.** **For UI features: Always include task 0.5 "Setup frontend design tooling" immediately after the branch task.** Use your judgement on how many additional high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about 5. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level tasks based on your requirements. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."

5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".

6.  **Phase 2: Generate Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task and cover the implementation details implied by the requirements. **If memory recall found relevant patterns, follow them.**

7.  **Identify Relevant Files:** Based on the tasks, requirements, and **knowledge tree** (if available at `${PROJECT}/.claude/knowledge-tree.json`), identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Files` section, including corresponding test files if applicable.

8.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.

9.  **Save Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/tasks/` directory with the filename `tasks-[feature-name].md`, where `[feature-name]` describes the main feature or task being implemented. **Note:** The `prd-roadmap-sync` hook will automatically update ROADMAP.md when this file is saved.

## Output Format

The generated task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Files

- `path/to/potential/file1.ts` - Brief description of why this file is relevant (e.g., Contains the main component for this feature).
- `path/to/file1.test.ts` - Unit tests for `file1.ts`.
- `path/to/another/file.tsx` - Brief description (e.g., API route handler for data submission).
- `path/to/another/file.test.tsx` - Unit tests for `another/file.tsx`.
- `lib/utils/helpers.ts` - Brief description (e.g., Utility functions needed for calculations).
- `lib/utils/helpers.test.ts` - Unit tests for `helpers.ts`.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Instructions for Completing Tasks

**IMPORTANT:** As you complete each task, you must check it off in this markdown file by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`. This helps track progress and ensures you don't skip any steps.

Example:
- `- [ ] 1.1 Read file` → `- [x] 1.1 Read file` (after completing)

Update the file after completing each sub-task, not just after completing an entire parent task.

## Tasks

- [ ] 0.0 Create feature branch
  - [ ] 0.1 Create and checkout a new branch for this feature (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]`)
- [ ] 0.5 Setup frontend design tooling (REQUIRED for UI features)
  - [ ] 0.5.1 Load frontend-design plugin: Read `~/.claude/plugins/frontend-design` patterns
  - [ ] 0.5.2 Load shadcn-create skill: Read `~/.claude/skills/shadcn-create/SKILL.md`
  - [ ] 0.5.3 Research components via shadcn MCP: Use `mcp__21st-dev-magic__search_components` to find relevant components
  - [ ] 0.5.4 Document component plan: List components to use from shadcn/ui library
- [ ] 1.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1 [Sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Sub-task description 2.1]
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Task Title (may not require sub-tasks if purely structural or configuration)
```

## Frontend Design Tooling (MANDATORY for UI features)

If the PRD contains a "Frontend Design Stack" section or the feature includes UI components, task 0.5 is MANDATORY with these exact sub-tasks:

```markdown
- [ ] 0.5 Setup frontend design tooling
  - [ ] 0.5.1 Load frontend-design plugin: Read `~/.claude/plugins/frontend-design` for design system patterns
  - [ ] 0.5.2 Load shadcn-create skill: Read `~/.claude/skills/shadcn-create/SKILL.md` for theming guidance
  - [ ] 0.5.3 Research components via shadcn MCP: Use component search to find relevant shadcn/ui components
  - [ ] 0.5.4 Document component plan: Create list of shadcn/ui components to use
```

### Why This Matters

- **frontend-design plugin**: Provides design system rules, component patterns, and visual consistency guidelines
- **shadcn-create skill**: Contains 800+ lines of theming guidance, MCP tool usage, and component customization patterns
- **shadcn MCP**: Enables component discovery and implementation research before coding

### During Implementation

Each UI task should reference the design tooling:
- Before creating a component → Check shadcn/ui library via MCP
- When styling → Follow frontend-design plugin patterns
- When theming → Use shadcn-create skill guidance

## Interaction Model

The process explicitly requires a pause after generating parent tasks to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate the detailed sub-tasks. This ensures the high-level plan aligns with user expectations before diving into details.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the task list is a **junior developer** who will implement the feature.
