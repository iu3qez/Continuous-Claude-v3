# PRD-004: AI Agent Integration

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** Draft
**Priority:** Critical

---

## Executive Summary

Integrate an AI agent system into SPARK Platform using the Claude Agent SDK, providing executives and EAs with an intelligent assistant for meeting preparation, action extraction, decision analysis, and proactive follow-up. The agent operates through a persistent sidebar panel with multiple specialized modes, full platform context access, and an approval-based workflow for all agent-initiated changes.

---

## Vision Statement

Transform executive leadership workflows by embedding AI intelligence throughout the meeting lifecycle. The agent becomes a tireless assistant that prepares briefings before meetings, captures commitments during meetings, tracks accountability after meetings, and surfaces patterns across the organizational decision-making history. Every interaction respects human authority through a "draft and approve" model.

---

## Problem Statement

Executive Assistants and leaders currently face significant manual overhead:

- **Meeting preparation takes hours** - Gathering context, reviewing past decisions, checking open actions
- **Action extraction is error-prone** - Important commitments get missed or misattributed
- **Follow-up tracking is manual** - No proactive nudging when items go stale
- **Pattern recognition is impossible** - Cannot see decision trends across months of meetings
- **Institutional knowledge is siloed** - Hard to surface "we discussed this before" moments

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement | Target |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Performance | First token latency | < 1 second |
| Performance | Token generation rate | > 30 tokens/second perceived |
| Performance | Context window management | Truncate/summarize for long contexts |
| Reliability | Error handling | Graceful degradation, retry logic |
| Reliability | Offline behavior | Clear messaging, queue actions |
| Scalability | Concurrent users | Support 100+ simultaneous agent sessions |
| Cost | Token usage optimization | Efficient prompts, caching where possible |
| Security | Data access scoping | User can only access their authorized data |

---

## Security and Privacy Considerations

### Role-Based Context Scoping

- Agent can only access data user has permission to view
- Context selector limited by user role
- Organization boundaries enforced
- Meeting access respects invite lists

### Audit Trail

- All agent conversations logged with:
  - User ID, timestamp, messages
  - Context scope
  - Tools invoked
  - Items proposed
  - Approval/rejection decisions
- Audit log accessible to org admins
- Retention policy: 2 years minimum

### Prompt Security

- No sensitive data in system prompts
- User input sanitized before API calls
- PII handling per privacy policy
- No credentials or secrets in context

### API Security

- API key stored in environment, never exposed to client
- Request signing/validation
- Rate limiting per user (e.g., 100 requests/hour)
- Token budget per user per day

### Visual Design Elements

- **Sidebar background:** Subtle contrast from main content
- **User messages:** Right-aligned, primary color bubble
- **Agent messages:** Left-aligned, neutral background
- **Approval cards:** Border highlight, action buttons prominent
- **Mode indicator:** Colored badge matching mode
- **Streaming cursor:** Blinking cursor during generation

### Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop (>1024px):** Side-by-side with main content
- **Tablet (768-1024px):** Overlay panel, slide from right
- **Mobile (<768px):** Full-screen takeover when open

---

## Technical Approach

### Claude Agent SDK Integration

```typescript
// lib/agent/client.ts
import { Agent } from '@anthropic-ai/agent-sdk';

const agent = new Agent({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  tools: platformTools,
  systemPrompt: buildSystemPrompt(mode, context),
});

export async function* streamAgentResponse(messages, context) {
  const stream = await agent.stream({
    messages,
    context: buildContext(context),
  });
  
  for await (const event of stream) {
    yield event;
  }
}
```

### Streaming API Route

```typescript
// app/api/agent/chat/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { messages, mode, context } = await request.json();
  
  const stream = new TransformStream();
  const writer = stream.writable.getWriter();
  
  streamAgentResponse(messages, { mode, ...context })
    .then(async (generator) => {
      for await (const chunk of generator) {
        await writer.write(encode(chunk));
      }
      await writer.close();
    });
  
  return new Response(stream.readable, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream' },
  });
}
```

### Platform MCP Server Tools

```typescript
const platformTools = [
  {
    name: "getMeetings",
    description: "Retrieve meetings within scope",
    parameters: { dateRange, series, attendees }
  },
  {
    name: "getMeetingDetails",
    description: "Get full meeting content including notes",
    parameters: { meetingId }
  },
  {
    name: "getActionItems",
    description: "Retrieve action items with filters",
    parameters: { status, owner, meetingId, dueDateRange }
  },
  {
    name: "getDecisions",
    description: "Retrieve decisions with filters",
    parameters: { search, meetingId, decidedBy, dateRange }
  },
  {
    name: "proposeActionItem",
    description: "Propose a new action item for user approval",
    parameters: { title, description, owner, dueDate, priority, meetingId }
  },
  {
    name: "proposeDecision",
    description: "Propose a new decision for user approval",
    parameters: { title, description, rationale, decidedBy, meetingId }
  },
  {
    name: "searchContent",
    description: "Semantic search across all platform content",
    parameters: { query, contentTypes, dateRange }
  },
  {
    name: "getPersonContext",
    description: "Get context about a person (role, recent activity)",
    parameters: { personId }
  }
];
```

### State Management

```typescript
// hooks/useAgentChat.ts
export function useAgentChat() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>([]);
  const [isStreaming, setIsStreaming] = useState(false);
  const [pendingApprovals, setPendingApprovals] = useState<Proposal[]>([]);
  
  const sendMessage = async (content: string, mode: AgentMode, context: Context) => {
    setMessages(prev => [...prev, { role: "user", content }]);
    setIsStreaming(true);
    
    const response = await fetch("/api/agent/chat", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({ messages: [...messages, { role: "user", content }], mode, context })
    });
    
    const reader = response.body.getReader();
    let agentMessage = "";
    
    while (true) {
      const { done, value } = await reader.read();
      if (done) break;
      
      const chunk = decode(value);
      agentMessage += chunk.text;
      setMessages(prev => updateLastMessage(prev, agentMessage));
      
      if (chunk.proposals) {
        setPendingApprovals(prev => [...prev, ...chunk.proposals]);
      }
    }
    
    setIsStreaming(false);
  };
  
  return { messages, sendMessage, isStreaming, pendingApprovals };
}
```
